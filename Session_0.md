    and selecting Hide Game Library)

###

    At the time of writing this documentation, the current engine
    version was 4.26.1. When a new update to version 4.26 is released,
    it won't be possible to install version 4.26.1 from the launcher.
    In that case, just install whatever 4.26.X version of the engine
    is available.


###

10: The "Folder" parameter is the path where all future versions of the engine will be installed to. The "Path" parameter is where the current version of the engine will be installed to.

11: Click on **Options**

  - 12: Make sure that only selected options are:
      * Core Components
      * Starter Content
      * Templates and Feature Packs

      Uncheck everything else, as those options deal with:
      * generating a c++ project
      * releasing the game to various platforms (ios/android/linux/etc)
      <details>
      <summary>click on expand. </summary>

    Notes: you can install the optional components if you want,
    but we won't need them in this workshop.

    If you get an error "DP-06", try:
      * updating the Launcher
      * restarting the Launcher
      * running the Launcher as Admin
      * turning off the VPN
