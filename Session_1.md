### [Creating a new project](https://github.com/Bleeck/UE_Workshop/blob/main/Session_1.md)
  - 1: <span style ="color:pink"> Launch the "Epic Games Launcher".</span>
  - 2: <span style ="color:pink"> Navigate to Unreal Engine->Library</span>
  - 3: <span style ="color:pink"> Click on launch on version 4.26.1 (or whatever 4.26.X version you have installed)</span>

  </details>  

###

    After a few seconds the editor should start and you will be presented with
    the Unreal Project Browser.

    Note: You might be asked to install additional features. Allow
    the editor to install what it needs (like dotnet 3.5 etc).

  - 4:  <span style ="color:pink"> Select Games. Click Next.</span>
  - 5:  <span style ="color:pink"> Select First Person. Click Next".</span>
  - 6:  <span style ="color:pink"> Leave settings to default and set a project location and name. Click Create Project.</span>

###

    The Unreal Project Browser allows you to open an existing project or create
    a new one.
    When creating a new project there are two main aspects to consider:
      - the template project to start from
      - blueprint or C++ project

    While you don't need to start from a template project, as you can rebuild
    everything yourself, it's not recommended as the template projects are
    often good starting points (at least for learning purposes).

    Selecting C++ will generate a .sln file that needs to be opened with Visual
    Studio. C++ falls outside the scope of this workshop. We will be sticking
    with Blueprints because they are:
      - easier to understand
      - sufficient for building a complete game (that doesn't heavily deviate
      from the standard systems already implemented in unreal)

  [Where C++ is more or less mandatory](https://forums.unrealengine.com/community/general-discussion/121087-blueprints-vs-c-programming-which-one-to-use?148076-Blueprints-Vs-C-Programming-Which-one-to-use=&viewfull=1#post1013378)

    * Actor placement browser : this usually doesn't get used that much. Mostly
    used to place lights and volumes
    * ToolBar : Quick access to commonly used commands and menus
    * Content Browser : the asset library of the project
    * World Outliner : lists all of the actors placed in a level
    * Details : shows the properties of the selected level object

### [Play In Editor](https://github.com/Bleeck/UE_Workshop/blob/main/Session_1.md)

<details>

    PIE. By clicking on the play button (or pressing alt + P) the
    editor enters Play in Editor mode. In this mode, the game is running in the
    viewport. To exit PIE press the escape key.

    When PIE starts, LMB clicking in the viewport will lock the mouse cursor to
    that viewport. To release the cursor either press Escape to stop PIE or press
    Shift + F1 to regain control. After regaining control, if you click back
    in the viewport, you will again lose control. In order to select and
    manipulate objects during PIE, click on the Eject Button (or press F8).



<span style = "color:red">WARNING</span>: All changes done in the level during play in     editor are LOST when exiting PIE.

### [Editor Settings](https://github.com/Bleeck/UE_Workshop/blob/main/Session_1.md)
  <details>
  <summary> Open Editor Preferences </summary>

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary> Type in "Search Details" textbox to filter settings </summary>

  </details>


  <details>
  <summary> Disable Autosave </summary>

  ![](./Assets/Session1/disable_autosave.jpg)
  </details>

      I personally never rely on autosave.

  <details>
  <summary> Disable Game Sound </summary>

  ![](./Assets/Session1/disable_game_sounds.jpg)
  </details>

      If you don't need game sounds, it's easier to just disable them in the
      editor.


  <details>
  <summary> Disable Use Camera Location From Play In Viewport </summary>

  ![](./Assets/Session1/camera_location.jpg)
  </details>

    This setting will cause the viewport camera to return to where it was before
    the PIE session started. Useful if you're editing a mission and don't want
    to have to keep navigating to the mission start location.


  <details>
  <summary> Enable Blueprint Save On Successful Compile </summary>

  ![](./Assets/Session1/save_on_compile.jpg)
  </details>

      This setting will cause the editor to automatically save your blueprint
      when it successfully compiles. I've found that it is extremely rare that
      you don't also click the save button after compiling (and it's usually because
      you forget to save)

#### Mouse Cursor Icon :
     The default mouse cursor behavior makes the cursor difficult to see in the
     editor viewport. The editor uses the windows "Precision" cursor while the mouse
     is over the viewport. In order to change it perform the following steps:

  <details>
  <summary> 1: Search and open "mouse settings" in start menu </summary>

  </details>   

  <details>
  <summary> 2: Click on "Additional Mouse Options" </summary>

  <details>
  <summary> 3: Go to "Pointers" -> select "Precision Cursor" -> Click on browser </summary>

  </details>   

  <details>
  <summary> 4: Navigate to "C:/Windows/Cursors" and select "aero_arrow.cur". Click on "Open" </summary>

  </details>

  <summary> 5: Click OK to close the window</summary>
